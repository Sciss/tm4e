# Eclipse tm4e.core - TextMate support for Java

Fork of https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e that only contains the core project. Uses sbt for building.

TM4E brings Java API to tokenize textual documents according to TextMate grammars, for example to do syntax highlighting according to this tokenization.
The core module is a Java port of [vscode-textmate](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-textmate) written in TypeScript. This Java API can be used with any 
Java UI Toolkit (Swing, Eclipse, etc). See [Core](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/wiki/Core) section for more information.
